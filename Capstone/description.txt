Dynamic Feature Store Dashboard
Real-Time AI/ML Feature Store with Kafka → Redis → MongoDB → React Dashboard

Project :
=======
The Dynamic Feature Store Dashboard is a full-stack application designed to simulate the real-time processing, storage, and visualization of machine learning features.
This system continuously collects computed features (e.g., user engagement rates, transaction counts, refund ratios), stores them in MongoDB, and presents them on a live React.js dashboard.
The architecture is inspired by feature stores used in production-level ML pipelines (e.g., in Netflix, Uber, or Google), where feature computation and retrieval are decoupled from ML training and prediction systems.

Architecture
============

Flow:

Kafka → Redis → MongoDB → Express.js API → React Frontend

Layer	          Technology	                   Role
Frontend	       React.js	               Displays real-time computed features as interactive cards
Backend	        Node.js + Express.js	   REST API handling feature storage, retrieval, and updates
Database	       MongoDB	               Persistent storage for features and feature history
Message Broker     Kafka            	   Streams live updates for computed features
Cache (optional)   Redis	               Used for fast feature lookups
Visualization	 React + React Icons	   Visual representation of each   feature card with dynamic freshness indicators

Features:
========

Frontend
--------
- Built with React.js
- Responsive card-based dashboard design
- Displays multiple features dynamically with icons, timestamps, and “Fresh/Stale” indicators
- Auto-refreshes data every 10 seconds using Axios polling
- Styled with modern gradients and dark theme for production-like UI

Backend
-------
- RESTful API built using Express.js
- CRUD operations for feature management
- Integrated MongoDB using Mongoose ODM
- Includes rate-limiting, logging, and authentication support (scalable structure)
- Modular route-based structure for easy maintenance

Database Layer
--------------
- MongoDB stores all features with timestamps
- “featurestore” database contains collections like:
    + features → current computed features.
    + feature_history → archived feature versions
    + Indexed for efficient queries and real-time reads

Example Data Flow
==================
The backend reads or receives new computed feature values (e.g., from Kafka).
                            |
Each feature (like rolling_avg_amount or txn_count_7d) is stored in MongoDB.
                            |
The frontend (React) fetches this data via an API call to.

API Endpoints
============

GET /features
-------------

Fetches all stored features.

Request Example:

GET http://localhost:3000/features?entityId=user1&set=user_profile_rolling


Response Example:

{
  "entityId": "user1",
  "set": "user_profile_rolling",
  "features": [
    { "name": "rolling_avg_amount", "value": 300, "timestamp": "2025-11-06T05:16:31.126Z" },
    { "name": "txn_count_7d", "value": 15, "timestamp": "2025-11-06T05:16:31.126Z" }
  ]
}

POST /features
==============

Adds a new feature into MongoDB.

Request Example:

{
  "name": "average_order_value",
  "value": 2450
}


Response Example:

{
  "message": "Feature added successfully",
  "feature": {
    "_id": "6737c5d3e41234ab...",
    "name": "average_order_value",
    "value": 2450,
    "timestamp": "2025-11-06T07:40:22.000Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
}

Installation Guide
==================
1️) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-feature-store.git
cd dynamic-feature-store

      npm install

3) Run the backend
     cd Backend
     npm run dev
